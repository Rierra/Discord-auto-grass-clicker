If you prefer to run the script manually (or want to modify it), you need Python installed.

1️⃣ Install Requirements

You'll need pyautogui and keyboard. Install them using:

```sh
pip install pyautogui keyboard
```
2️⃣ Run the Script
```sh
python app.py
```
Make sure ```grass_button.png``` is in the same folder.
