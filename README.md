 You can either run the Python script manually or use the precompiled .exe file.

**!USING THE SCRIPT METHOD!**
 
1️⃣ Install Requirements

You'll need pyautogui and keyboard. Install them using:

```sh
pip install pyautogui keyboard
```
2️⃣ Run the Script
```sh
python app.py
```
Make sure ```grass_button.png``` is in the same folder.

---

**!USING THE EXECUTABLE METHOD!**

If you don't want to install Python, use the precompiled .exe file instead:

1. [Download the latest release.](https://github.com/Rierra/Discord-auto-grass-clicker/releases/tag/v1.0)

2. Place grass_button.png in the same folder as the .exe.

3.Run app.exe (Windows might warn you since it's an unsigned executable).

⚠️ NOTE

**Ensure the game window is visible on your screen when running the script.**
